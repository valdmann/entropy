Entropy coding
==============

A collection of miscellanious entropy coders, currently all range coders.

• exp_flux.c — fpaq-style exp weighted binary model +
               range coder with accurate carries, bytewise renorm,
               overflow detected with 64-bit mul and handled in renorm loop.

• exp_flux_0.c — same, but omits a branch in renorm loop at the cost of one
                 zero byte emitted at start of output.

• exp_flux_0_bio.c — same, but uses manual block-wise I/O —
                     insignificant perf increase, better error handling

• exp_mahoney_32.c — same model with mahoney-style carryless range coder.

• exp_mahoney_64.c — same with 64-bit precision.

• max.c — binary model with decaying adaptation rate — closer approximation of
          ideal stationary model — not that good on non-stationary data;
          same rc as exp_flux_0.c.

• periodic.c — 256-ary model with periodic adaptation and table-accelerated
               decoding; same rc as exp_flux_0.c.
